        question: "What are props?",

        question: "What is conditional rendering?",
        answer: `Rendering or not rendering a component/segment of a component depending upon whether or not a condition is met. Conditional rendering is typically done with the ternary operator.`

      {
        id: 5,
        question: "What is a controlled component?",
        answer: `An element such as <input>, <textarea>, or <select> which do not maintain their own state, but rely on React's state to be the single source of truth.
                To control a component, you must:
                1. Set the value of the component to a corresponding property of the state.
                2. Provide an "onChange" method that updates the corresponding state value upon user input.`
